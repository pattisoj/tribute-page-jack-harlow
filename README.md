# Tribute Page

The first repository I ever created - a tribute page to my favourite musical artist Jack Harlow.

## Repository explaination

On the 16th April 2022 I uploaded this repository to GitHub. It was my frist ever experience with creating a repository and was part of my pre-course learning for the [School of Code](https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/). Starting from ['README - Learning Journey step 7'](#readme---learning-journey-step-7) you will find the origional documentation that explained the process I had to follow/learn about. The origional code that I created as my tribute page for Jack Harlow is still here in the main branch. I decided to come back after my 16 weeks at the bootcamp and pay homage to my first ever piece of work and change the style slightly and improve it's look. You can find the code for that by switching over to the ['new-tribute-page' branch](). I additioanlly changed the name of this repository on the 10th of August 2022 to be more consistent with the kebab case formatting I have been using as this origionally followed pascal case (Stage2Step7TributePage).

### 7.2 - Your Tribute Page

You will now be using git and vscode to:

  * _clone_ your repository to your local machine (use the HTTPS link)

  * _update_ the sample HTML and CSS files with your own code (from CodePen) 

  * _add, commit and push_ your changes to your brand new repository. Pretty cool eh?

  All of these steps have been covered in step 6 of your *learning journey* if you need any clues as to what to do maybe think about looking back at these resources ðŸ¤·

This branch holds the content of the improvements to my tribute page that was my first ever creation. I wanted to use my new knowledge of HTML and CSS to make some improvements.

#### This branch will not be merged.

## Goals

When I decided to update the tribute page these were my goals:

- Keep the content the same (_Or as close to the original as possible_)
- Make small improvements using only HTML & CSS (_It would be easy to make a fancy react app and it look better so I wanted to focus my alterations to try and improve the page with the sane tools I used to make it_)
- Have an improved page in this branch.

## Changes

- Firstly I stripped back the old content. Specifically removing the styling and old images. I then rebuilt the page from there.
  <br />
- I wanted to make the page more simplistic as a user wouldn't want to watch a slideshow to get their information.
  <br />
- I added an embedded spotify player, Jack Harlow is a musical artist so for me this was a key addition to the page.
  <br />
- After I gave the page it's more simple and consistent styling.
  <br />
- I also made the page more responsive as this was also something I was unaware of at the time of this repositories creation.

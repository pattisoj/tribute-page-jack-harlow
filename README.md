# New tribute page branch.

#### For more information on the repository as a whole please navigate to the main branch or click [here.](https://github.com/pattisoj/tribute-page-jack-harlow/tree/main)

This branch holds the content of the improvements to my tribute page that was my first ever creation. I wanted to use my new knowledge of HTML and CSS to make some improvements.

#### This branch will not be merged.

## Goals

When I decided to update the tribute page these were my goals:

- Keep the content the same (_Or as close to the original as possible_)
- Make small improvements using only HTML & CSS (_It would be easy to make a fancy react app and it look better so I wanted to focus my alterations to try and improve the page with the sane tools I used to make it_)
- Have an improved page in this branch.
